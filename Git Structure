The way git is set up and should be used.

Use the Master Branch only for Deployable Versions (Should be the current version on the App Stores)

Use the Development Branch as a Sub-Master for merging new features for the new/next version.

Use Seperate Branches for working on new features and then merge them back into the Development Branch once they are complete.
